# MongoDB Geospatial Data Management: SQL-Style Approaches to Location Queries

MongoDB offers powerful geospatial capabilities for storing and querying location-based data. Whether you're building a ride-sharing app, store locator, or IoT sensor network, understanding how to work with coordinates, distances, and geographic boundaries is essential.

While MongoDB's native geospatial operators like `$near` and `$geoWithin` handle spatial calculations, applying SQL thinking to location data helps structure queries and optimize performance for common location-based scenarios.

## The Geospatial Challenge

Consider a food delivery application that needs to:
- Find restaurants within 2km of a customer
- Check if a delivery address is within a restaurant's service area
- Calculate delivery routes and estimated travel times
- Analyze order density by geographic regions

Traditional MongoDB geospatial queries require understanding multiple operators and coordinate systems:

```javascript
// Sample restaurant document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Mario's Pizza",
  "cuisine": "Italian",
  "rating": 4.6,
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-122.4194, 37.7749] // [longitude, latitude]
  },
  "serviceArea": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
      [-122.4294, 37.7649],
      [-122.4094, 37.7649], 
      [-122.4094, 37.7849],
      [-122.4294, 37.7849],
      [-122.4294, 37.7649]
    ]]
  },
  "address": "123 Mission St, San Francisco, CA",
  "phone": "+1-555-0123",
  "deliveryFee": 2.99
}
```

Native MongoDB proximity search:

```javascript
// Find restaurants within 2km
db.restaurants.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-122.4194, 37.7749]
      },
      $maxDistance: 2000
    }
  }
})

// Check if point is within delivery area
db.restaurants.find({
  serviceArea: {
    $geoWithin: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-122.4150, 37.7700]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## SQL-Style Location Data Modeling

Using SQL concepts, we can structure location queries more systematically. While QueryLeaf doesn't directly support spatial functions, we can model location data using standard SQL patterns and coordinate these with MongoDB's native geospatial features:

```sql
-- Structure location data using SQL patterns
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  rating,
  location,
  address
FROM restaurants
WHERE location IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 10

-- Coordinate-based filtering (for approximate area queries)  
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  rating
FROM restaurants
WHERE latitude BETWEEN 37.7700 AND 37.7800
  AND longitude BETWEEN -122.4250 AND -122.4150
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

## Setting Up Location Indexes

For location-based queries, proper indexing is crucial:

### Coordinate Field Indexes

```sql
-- Index individual coordinate fields for range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_restaurants_coordinates 
ON restaurants (latitude, longitude)

-- Index location field for native MongoDB geospatial queries
CREATE INDEX idx_restaurants_location
ON restaurants (location)
```

MongoDB geospatial indexes (use native MongoDB commands):
```javascript
// For GeoJSON Point data
db.restaurants.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })

// For legacy coordinate pairs  
db.restaurants.createIndex({ coordinates: "2d" })

// Compound index combining location with other filters
db.restaurants.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere", cuisine: 1, rating: 1 })
```

## Location Query Patterns with QueryLeaf

### Bounding Box Queries

Use SQL range queries to implement approximate location searches:

```sql
-- Find restaurants in a rectangular area (bounding box approach)
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,  
  rating,
  latitude,
  longitude
FROM restaurants
WHERE latitude BETWEEN 37.7650 AND 37.7850
  AND longitude BETWEEN -122.4300 AND -122.4100
  AND rating >= 4.0
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 20

-- More precise filtering with nested location fields
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  rating,
  location.coordinates[0] AS longitude,
  location.coordinates[1] AS latitude  
FROM restaurants
WHERE location.coordinates[1] BETWEEN 37.7650 AND 37.7850
  AND location.coordinates[0] BETWEEN -122.4300 AND -122.4100
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

### Coordinate-Based Filtering

QueryLeaf supports standard SQL operations on coordinate fields:

```sql
-- Find restaurants near a specific point using coordinate ranges
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  rating,
  deliveryFee,
  latitude,
  longitude
FROM restaurants
WHERE latitude BETWEEN 37.7694 AND 37.7794  -- ~1km north-south
  AND longitude BETWEEN -122.4244 AND -122.4144  -- ~1km east-west  
  AND rating >= 4.0
  AND deliveryFee <= 5.00
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 15
```

### Polygon Containment

```sql
-- Check if delivery address is within service areas
SELECT 
  r.name,
  r.phone,
  r.deliveryFee,
  'Available' AS delivery_status
FROM restaurants r
WHERE ST_CONTAINS(r.serviceArea, ST_POINT(-122.4150, 37.7700))
  AND r.cuisine IN ('Italian', 'Chinese', 'Mexican')

-- Find all restaurants serving a specific neighborhood
WITH neighborhood AS (
  SELECT ST_POLYGON(ARRAY[
    ST_POINT(-122.4300, 37.7650),
    ST_POINT(-122.4100, 37.7650),
    ST_POINT(-122.4100, 37.7850),
    ST_POINT(-122.4300, 37.7850),
    ST_POINT(-122.4300, 37.7650)
  ]) AS boundary
)
SELECT 
  r.name,
  r.cuisine,
  r.rating
FROM restaurants r, neighborhood n
WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(r.serviceArea, n.boundary)
```

## Advanced Geospatial Operations

### Bounding Box Queries

```sql
-- Find restaurants in a rectangular area (bounding box)
SELECT name, cuisine, rating
FROM restaurants
WHERE ST_WITHIN(
  location,
  ST_BOX(
    ST_POINT(-122.4400, 37.7600),  -- Southwest corner
    ST_POINT(-122.4000, 37.7800)   -- Northeast corner
  )
)
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

### Circular Area Queries

```sql
-- Find all locations within a circular delivery zone
SELECT 
  name,
  address,
  ST_DISTANCE(location, ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)) AS distance
FROM restaurants
WHERE ST_WITHIN(
  location,
  ST_BUFFER(ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749), 1500)
)
ORDER BY distance ASC
```

### Route and Path Analysis

```sql
-- Calculate total distance along a delivery route
WITH route_points AS (
  SELECT UNNEST(ARRAY[
    ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749),  -- Start: Customer
    ST_POINT(-122.4150, 37.7700),  -- Stop 1: Restaurant A  
    ST_POINT(-122.4250, 37.7800),  -- Stop 2: Restaurant B
    ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)   -- End: Back to customer
  ]) AS point,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS seq
)
SELECT 
  SUM(ST_DISTANCE(curr.point, next.point)) AS total_distance_meters,
  SUM(ST_DISTANCE(curr.point, next.point)) / 1609.34 AS total_distance_miles
FROM route_points curr
JOIN route_points next ON curr.seq = next.seq - 1
```

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### Store Locator System

```sql
-- Comprehensive store locator with business hours
SELECT 
  s.name,
  s.address,
  s.phone,
  s.storeType,
  ST_DISTANCE(s.location, ST_POINT(?, ?)) AS distance_meters,
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN s.openHour AND s.closeHour 
    THEN 'Open'
    ELSE 'Closed'
  END AS status
FROM stores s
WHERE ST_DWITHIN(s.location, ST_POINT(?, ?), 10000)  -- 10km radius
  AND s.isActive = true
ORDER BY distance_meters ASC
LIMIT 20
```

### Real Estate Search

```sql
-- Find properties near amenities
WITH user_location AS (
  SELECT ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749) AS point
),
nearby_amenities AS (
  SELECT 
    p._id AS property_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN a.type = 'school' THEN 1 END) AS schools_nearby,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN a.type = 'grocery' THEN 1 END) AS groceries_nearby,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN a.type = 'transit' THEN 1 END) AS transit_nearby
  FROM properties p
  JOIN amenities a ON ST_DWITHIN(p.location, a.location, 1000)
  GROUP BY p._id
)
SELECT 
  p.address,
  p.price,
  p.bedrooms,
  p.bathrooms,
  ST_DISTANCE(p.location, ul.point) AS distance_to_user,
  na.schools_nearby,
  na.groceries_nearby,
  na.transit_nearby
FROM properties p
JOIN user_location ul ON ST_DWITHIN(p.location, ul.point, 5000)
LEFT JOIN nearby_amenities na ON p._id = na.property_id
WHERE p.price BETWEEN 500000 AND 800000
  AND p.bedrooms >= 2
ORDER BY 
  (na.schools_nearby + na.groceries_nearby + na.transit_nearby) DESC,
  distance_to_user ASC
```

### IoT Sensor Network

```javascript
// Sample IoT sensor document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "sensorId": "temp_001",
  "type": "temperature",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point", 
    "coordinates": [-122.4194, 37.7749]
  },
  "readings": [
    {
      "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-20T10:00:00Z"),
      "value": 22.5,
      "unit": "celsius"
    }
  ],
  "battery": 87,
  "lastSeen": ISODate("2025-08-20T10:05:00Z")
}
```

Spatial analysis of sensor data:

```sql
-- Find sensors in a specific area with recent anomalous readings
SELECT 
  s.sensorId,
  s.type,
  s.battery,
  s.lastSeen,
  r.timestamp,
  r.value,
  ST_DISTANCE(
    s.location, 
    ST_POINT(-122.4200, 37.7750)
  ) AS distance_from_center
FROM sensors s
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(s.readings) AS r
WHERE ST_WITHIN(
  s.location,
  ST_BOX(
    ST_POINT(-122.4300, 37.7700),
    ST_POINT(-122.4100, 37.7800) 
  )
)
AND r.timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
AND (
  (s.type = 'temperature' AND (r.value < 0 OR r.value > 40)) OR
  (s.type = 'humidity' AND (r.value < 10 OR r.value > 90))
)
ORDER BY r.timestamp DESC
```

## Performance Optimization

### Spatial Query Optimization

```sql
-- Optimize queries by limiting search area first
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  ST_DISTANCE(location, ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)) AS exact_distance
FROM restaurants
WHERE 
  -- Use bounding box for initial filtering (uses index efficiently)
  ST_WITHIN(location, ST_BOX(
    ST_POINT(-122.4244, 37.7699),  -- Southwest
    ST_POINT(-122.4144, 37.7799)   -- Northeast  
  ))
  -- Then apply precise distance filter
  AND ST_DWITHIN(location, ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749), 2000)
ORDER BY exact_distance ASC
```

### Compound Index Strategy

```sql
-- Create indexes that support both spatial and attribute filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_restaurants_location_rating_cuisine
ON restaurants (location, rating, cuisine)
USING GEO2DSPHERE

-- Query that leverages the compound index
SELECT name, rating, cuisine
FROM restaurants  
WHERE ST_DWITHIN(location, ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749), 3000)
  AND rating >= 4.0
  AND cuisine = 'Italian'
```

## Data Import and Coordinate Systems

### Converting Address to Coordinates

```sql
-- Geocoded restaurant data insertion
INSERT INTO restaurants (
  name,
  address, 
  location,
  cuisine
) VALUES (
  'Giuseppe''s Italian',
  '456 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA',
  ST_POINT(-122.4075, 37.7983),  -- Geocoded coordinates
  'Italian'
)

-- Bulk geocoding update for existing records
UPDATE restaurants 
SET location = ST_POINT(longitude, latitude)
WHERE location IS NULL
  AND longitude IS NOT NULL 
  AND latitude IS NOT NULL
```

### Working with Different Coordinate Systems

```sql
-- Convert between coordinate systems (if needed)
SELECT 
  name,
  location AS wgs84_point,
  ST_TRANSFORM(location, 3857) AS web_mercator_point
FROM restaurants
WHERE name LIKE '%Pizza%'
```

## Aggregation with Geospatial Data

### Density Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze restaurant density by geographic grid
WITH grid_cells AS (
  SELECT 
    FLOOR((ST_X(location) + 122.45) * 100) AS grid_x,
    FLOOR((ST_Y(location) - 37.75) * 100) AS grid_y,
    COUNT(*) AS restaurant_count,
    AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM restaurants
  WHERE ST_WITHIN(location, ST_BOX(
    ST_POINT(-122.45, 37.75),
    ST_POINT(-122.40, 37.80)
  ))
  GROUP BY grid_x, grid_y
)
SELECT 
  grid_x,
  grid_y,
  restaurant_count,
  ROUND(avg_rating, 2) AS avg_rating
FROM grid_cells
WHERE restaurant_count >= 5
ORDER BY restaurant_count DESC
```

### Service Coverage Analysis

```sql
-- Calculate total area covered by delivery services
SELECT 
  cuisine,
  COUNT(*) AS restaurant_count,
  SUM(ST_AREA(serviceArea)) AS total_coverage_sqm,
  AVG(deliveryFee) AS avg_delivery_fee
FROM restaurants
WHERE serviceArea IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cuisine
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY total_coverage_sqm DESC
```

## Combining QueryLeaf with MongoDB Geospatial Features

While QueryLeaf doesn't directly support spatial functions, you can combine SQL-style queries with MongoDB's native geospatial capabilities:

```sql
-- Use QueryLeaf for business logic and data filtering
SELECT 
  name,
  cuisine,
  rating,
  deliveryFee,
  estimatedDeliveryTime,
  location,
  isOpen,
  acceptingOrders
FROM restaurants
WHERE rating >= 4.0
  AND deliveryFee <= 5.00
  AND isOpen = true
  AND acceptingOrders = true
  AND location IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rating DESC
```

Then apply MongoDB geospatial operators in a second step:

```javascript
// Follow up with native MongoDB geospatial query
const candidateRestaurants = await queryLeaf.execute(sqlQuery);

// Filter by proximity using MongoDB's native operators
const nearbyRestaurants = await db.collection('restaurants').find({
  _id: { $in: candidateRestaurants.map(r => r._id) },
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-122.4194, 37.7749] },
      $maxDistance: 2000  // 2km
    }
  }
}).toArray();
```

## Best Practices for Geospatial Data

1. **Coordinate Order**: Always use [longitude, latitude] order in GeoJSON
2. **Index Strategy**: Create 2dsphere indexes on all spatial fields used in queries
3. **Query Optimization**: Use bounding boxes for initial filtering before precise distance calculations
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure coordinates are within valid ranges (-180 to 180 for longitude, -90 to 90 for latitude)
5. **Units Awareness**: MongoDB distances are in meters by default
6. **Precision**: Consider coordinate precision needs (6 decimal places ≈ 10cm accuracy)

## Conclusion

Working with location data in MongoDB requires understanding both SQL-style data modeling and MongoDB's native geospatial capabilities. While QueryLeaf doesn't directly support spatial functions, applying SQL thinking to location data helps structure queries and optimize performance.

Key strategies for location-based applications:

- **Data Modeling**: Store coordinates in both individual fields and GeoJSON format for flexibility
- **Query Patterns**: Use SQL range queries for approximate location searches and coordinate validation
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine QueryLeaf's SQL capabilities with MongoDB's native geospatial operators
- **Performance**: Leverage proper indexing strategies for both coordinate fields and GeoJSON data

Whether you're building delivery platforms, store locators, or IoT monitoring systems, understanding how to structure location queries gives you a solid foundation. You can start with SQL-style coordinate filtering using QueryLeaf, then enhance with MongoDB's powerful geospatial features when precise distance calculations and complex spatial relationships are needed.

The combination of familiar SQL patterns with MongoDB's document flexibility and native geospatial capabilities provides the tools needed for sophisticated location-aware applications that scale effectively.
