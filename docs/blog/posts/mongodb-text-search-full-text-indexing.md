# MongoDB Text Search and Full-Text Indexing: SQL-Style Search Queries

Building search functionality in MongoDB can be complex when working with the native operators. While MongoDB's `$text` and `$regex` operators are powerful, implementing comprehensive search features often requires understanding multiple MongoDB-specific concepts and syntax patterns.

Using SQL-style search queries makes text search more intuitive and maintainable, especially for teams familiar with traditional database search patterns.

## The Text Search Challenge

Consider a content management system with articles, products, and user profiles. Traditional MongoDB text search involves multiple operators and complex aggregation pipelines:

```javascript
// Sample article document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "title": "Getting Started with MongoDB Indexing",
  "content": "MongoDB provides several types of indexes to optimize query performance. Understanding compound indexes, text indexes, and partial indexes is crucial for building scalable applications.",
  "author": "Jane Developer",
  "category": "Database",
  "tags": ["mongodb", "indexing", "performance", "databases"],
  "publishDate": ISODate("2025-08-15"),
  "status": "published",
  "wordCount": 1250,
  "readTime": 5
}
```

Native MongoDB search requires multiple approaches:

```javascript
// Basic text search
db.articles.find({
  $text: {
    $search: "mongodb indexing performance"
  }
})

// Complex search with multiple conditions
db.articles.find({
  $and: [
    { $text: { $search: "mongodb indexing" } },
    { status: "published" },
    { category: "Database" },
    { publishDate: { $gte: ISODate("2025-01-01") } }
  ]
}).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })

// Regex-based partial matches
db.articles.find({
  $or: [
    { title: { $regex: "mongodb", $options: "i" } },
    { content: { $regex: "mongodb", $options: "i" } }
  ]
})
```

## SQL-Style Text Search

The same searches become much more readable with SQL syntax:

```sql
-- Basic full-text search
SELECT title, author, publishDate, 
       MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS relevance
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb indexing performance')
  AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY relevance DESC

-- Advanced search with multiple criteria
SELECT title, author, category, readTime,
       MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
FROM articles  
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb indexing')
  AND category = 'Database'
  AND publishDate >= '2025-01-01'
  AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY score DESC, publishDate DESC
```

## Setting Up Text Indexes

Before performing text searches, you need appropriate indexes. Here's how to create them:

### Basic Text Index

```sql
-- Create text index on multiple fields
CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_search 
ON articles (title, content)
```

MongoDB equivalent:
```javascript
db.articles.createIndex({ 
  title: "text", 
  content: "text" 
})
```

### Weighted Text Index

Give different importance to various fields:

```sql
-- Create weighted text index
CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_weighted_search 
ON articles (title, content, tags)
WITH WEIGHTS (title: 10, content: 5, tags: 1)
```

MongoDB syntax:
```javascript
db.articles.createIndex(
  { title: "text", content: "text", tags: "text" },
  { weights: { title: 10, content: 5, tags: 1 } }
)
```

### Language-Specific Text Index

```sql
-- Create text index with language specification
CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_english_search 
ON articles (title, content)
WITH LANGUAGE 'english'
```

MongoDB equivalent:
```javascript
db.articles.createIndex(
  { title: "text", content: "text" },
  { default_language: "english" }
)
```

## Search Query Patterns

### Exact Phrase Search

```sql
-- Search for exact phrases
SELECT title, author, MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('"compound indexes"')
  AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY score DESC
```

### Boolean Search Operations

```sql
-- Advanced boolean search
SELECT title, author, category
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb +indexing -aggregation')
  AND status = 'published'

-- Search with OR conditions
SELECT title, author
FROM articles  
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('indexing OR performance OR optimization')
  AND category IN ('Database', 'Performance')
```

### Case-Insensitive Pattern Matching

```sql
-- Partial string matching
SELECT title, author, category
FROM articles
WHERE title ILIKE '%mongodb%'
   OR content ILIKE '%mongodb%'
   OR ARRAY_TO_STRING(tags, ' ') ILIKE '%mongodb%'

-- Using REGEX for complex patterns
SELECT title, author
FROM articles
WHERE title REGEX '(?i)mongo.*db'
   OR content REGEX '(?i)index(ing|es)?'
```

## Advanced Search Features

### Search with Aggregations

Combine text search with analytical queries:

```sql
-- Search results with category breakdown
SELECT 
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS articleCount,
  AVG(MATCH_SCORE(title, content)) AS avgRelevance,
  AVG(readTime) AS avgReadTime
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb performance')
  AND status = 'published'
  AND publishDate >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avgRelevance DESC
```

### Search with JOIN Operations

```sql
-- Search articles with author information
SELECT 
  a.title,
  a.publishDate,
  u.name AS authorName,
  u.expertise,
  MATCH_SCORE(a.title, a.content) AS relevance
FROM articles a
JOIN users u ON a.author = u.username
WHERE MATCH(a.title, a.content) AGAINST ('indexing strategies')
  AND a.status = 'published'
  AND u.isActive = true
ORDER BY relevance DESC, a.publishDate DESC
```

### Faceted Search Results

```sql
-- Get search results with facet counts
WITH search_results AS (
  SELECT *,
         MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
  FROM articles
  WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb optimization')
    AND status = 'published'
)
SELECT 
  'results' AS type,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  JSON_AGG(
    JSON_BUILD_OBJECT(
      'title', title,
      'author', author,
      'category', category,
      'score', score
    )
  ) AS data
FROM search_results
WHERE score > 0.5

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'categories' AS type,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  JSON_AGG(
    JSON_BUILD_OBJECT(
      'category', category,
      'count', category_count
    )
  ) AS data
FROM (
  SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS category_count
  FROM search_results
  GROUP BY category
) category_facets
```

## Performance Optimization

### Index Strategy for Search

Create compound indexes that support both search and filtering:

```sql
-- Compound index for search + filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_search_filter 
ON articles (status, category, publishDate)

-- Combined with text index for optimal performance
CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_content_search
ON articles (title, content)
```

### Search Result Pagination

```sql
-- Efficient pagination for search results
SELECT title, author, publishDate,
       MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('mongodb tutorial')
  AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY score DESC, _id ASC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40
```

### Search Performance Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze search query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT title, author, MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('performance optimization')
  AND category = 'Database'
  AND publishDate >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Real-World Search Implementation

### E-commerce Product Search

```javascript
// Sample product document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "MacBook Pro 16-inch M3",
  "description": "Powerful laptop with M3 chip, perfect for development and creative work",
  "brand": "Apple",
  "category": "Laptops",
  "subcategory": "Professional",
  "price": 2499.99,
  "features": ["M3 chip", "16GB RAM", "1TB SSD", "Liquid Retina Display"],
  "tags": ["laptop", "apple", "macbook", "professional", "development"],
  "inStock": true,
  "rating": 4.8,
  "reviewCount": 1247
}
```

Comprehensive product search query:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.brand,
  p.price,
  p.rating,
  p.reviewCount,
  MATCH_SCORE(p.name, p.description) AS textScore,
  -- Boost score based on rating and reviews
  (MATCH_SCORE(p.name, p.description) * 0.7 + 
   (p.rating / 5.0) * 0.2 + 
   LOG(p.reviewCount + 1) * 0.1) AS finalScore
FROM products p
WHERE MATCH(p.name, p.description) AGAINST ('macbook pro development')
  AND p.inStock = true
  AND p.price BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000
  AND p.rating >= 4.0
ORDER BY finalScore DESC, p.reviewCount DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Content Discovery System

```sql
-- Find related articles based on search terms and user preferences
WITH user_interests AS (
  SELECT UNNEST(interests) AS interest
  FROM users 
  WHERE _id = ?
),
search_matches AS (
  SELECT 
    a.*,
    MATCH_SCORE(a.title, a.content) AS textScore
  FROM articles a
  WHERE MATCH(a.title, a.content) AGAINST (?)
    AND a.status = 'published'
    AND a.publishDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
)
SELECT 
  s.title,
  s.author,
  s.category,
  s.publishDate,
  s.readTime,
  s.textScore,
  -- Boost articles matching user interests
  CASE 
    WHEN s.category IN (SELECT interest FROM user_interests) THEN s.textScore * 1.5
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_interests ui 
      WHERE s.tags @> ARRAY[ui.interest]
    ) THEN s.textScore * 1.2
    ELSE s.textScore
  END AS personalizedScore
FROM search_matches s
ORDER BY personalizedScore DESC, s.publishDate DESC
LIMIT 15
```

## Multi-Language Search Support

### Language Detection and Indexing

```sql
-- Create language-specific indexes
CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_english 
ON articles (title, content) 
WHERE language = 'english'
WITH LANGUAGE 'english'

CREATE TEXT INDEX idx_articles_spanish 
ON articles (title, content) 
WHERE language = 'spanish'
WITH LANGUAGE 'spanish'
```

### Multi-Language Search Query

```sql
-- Search across multiple languages
SELECT 
  title,
  author,
  language,
  MATCH_SCORE(title, content) AS score
FROM articles
WHERE (
  (language = 'english' AND MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('database performance'))
  OR 
  (language = 'spanish' AND MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('rendimiento base datos'))
)
AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY score DESC
```

## Search Analytics and Insights

### Search Term Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze popular search terms (from search logs)
SELECT 
  searchTerm,
  COUNT(*) AS searchCount,
  AVG(resultCount) AS avgResults,
  AVG(clickThroughRate) AS avgCTR
FROM search_logs
WHERE searchDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND resultCount > 0
GROUP BY searchTerm
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY searchCount DESC, avgCTR DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Content Gap Analysis

```sql
-- Find search terms with low result counts
SELECT 
  sl.searchTerm,
  COUNT(*) AS searchFrequency,
  AVG(sl.resultCount) AS avgResultCount
FROM search_logs sl
WHERE sl.searchDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND sl.resultCount < 5
GROUP BY sl.searchTerm
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY searchFrequency DESC
```

## QueryLeaf Integration

When using QueryLeaf for MongoDB text search, you gain several advantages:

```sql
-- QueryLeaf automatically optimizes this complex search query
SELECT 
  a.title,
  a.author,
  a.publishDate,
  u.name AS authorFullName,
  u.expertise,
  MATCH_SCORE(a.title, a.content) AS relevance,
  -- Complex scoring with user engagement metrics
  (MATCH_SCORE(a.title, a.content) * 0.6 + 
   LOG(a.viewCount + 1) * 0.2 + 
   a.socialShares * 0.2) AS engagementScore
FROM articles a
JOIN users u ON a.author = u.username
WHERE MATCH(a.title, a.content) AGAINST ('mongodb indexing performance optimization')
  AND a.status = 'published'
  AND a.publishDate >= '2025-01-01'
  AND u.isActive = true
  AND a.category IN ('Database', 'Performance', 'Tutorial')
ORDER BY engagementScore DESC, a.publishDate DESC
LIMIT 25
```

QueryLeaf handles the complex MongoDB aggregation pipeline generation, text index utilization, and query optimization automatically.
