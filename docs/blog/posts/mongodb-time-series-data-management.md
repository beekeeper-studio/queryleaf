# MongoDB Time-Series Data Management: SQL-Style Analytics for IoT and Metrics

Time-series data represents one of the fastest-growing data types in modern applications. From IoT sensor readings and application performance metrics to financial market data and user activity logs, time-series collections require specialized storage strategies and query patterns for optimal performance.

MongoDB's native time-series collections, introduced in version 5.0, provide powerful capabilities for storing and analyzing temporal data. Combined with SQL-style query patterns, you can build efficient time-series applications that scale to millions of data points while maintaining familiar development patterns.

## The Time-Series Challenge

Consider an IoT monitoring system collecting data from thousands of sensors across multiple facilities. Each sensor generates readings every minute, creating millions of documents daily:

```javascript
// Traditional document structure - inefficient for time-series
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "sensor_id": "temp_001",
  "facility": "warehouse_A",
  "measurement_type": "temperature",
  "value": 23.5,
  "unit": "celsius",
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-24T14:30:00Z"),
  "location": {
    "building": "A",
    "floor": 2,
    "room": "storage_1"
  }
}
```

Storing time-series data in regular collections leads to several problems:

```sql
-- SQL queries on regular collections become inefficient
SELECT 
  sensor_id,
  AVG(value) AS avg_temp,
  MAX(value) AS max_temp,
  MIN(value) AS min_temp
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE measurement_type = 'temperature'
  AND timestamp >= '2025-08-24 00:00:00'
  AND timestamp < '2025-08-25 00:00:00'
GROUP BY sensor_id, DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp);

-- Problems:
-- - Poor compression (repetitive metadata)
-- - Inefficient indexing for temporal queries  
-- - Slow aggregations across time ranges
-- - High storage overhead
```

## MongoDB Time-Series Collections

MongoDB time-series collections optimize storage and query performance for temporal data:

```javascript
// Create optimized time-series collection
db.createCollection("sensor_readings", {
  timeseries: {
    timeField: "timestamp",      // Required: timestamp field
    metaField: "metadata",       // Optional: unchanging metadata
    granularity: "minutes"       // Optional: seconds, minutes, hours
  }
})

// Optimized document structure
{
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-24T14:30:00Z"),
  "temperature": 23.5,
  "humidity": 65.2,
  "pressure": 1013.25,
  "metadata": {
    "sensor_id": "env_001",
    "facility": "warehouse_A", 
    "location": {
      "building": "A",
      "floor": 2,
      "room": "storage_1"
    },
    "sensor_type": "environmental"
  }
}
```

Benefits of time-series collections:

- **10x Storage Compression**: Efficient bucketing and compression
- **Faster Queries**: Optimized indexes for temporal ranges
- **Better Performance**: Specialized aggregation pipeline optimization
- **Automatic Bucketing**: MongoDB groups documents by time ranges

## SQL-Style Time-Series Queries

### Basic Temporal Filtering

Query recent sensor data with familiar SQL patterns:

```sql
-- Get last 24 hours of temperature readings
SELECT 
  metadata.sensor_id,
  metadata.location.room,
  timestamp,
  temperature,
  humidity
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND metadata.sensor_type = 'environmental'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- Equivalent time range query
SELECT *
FROM sensor_readings  
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2025-08-24 00:00:00' AND '2025-08-24 23:59:59'
  AND metadata.facility = 'warehouse_A';
```

### Temporal Aggregations

Perform time-based analytics using SQL aggregation functions:

```sql
-- Hourly temperature averages by location
SELECT 
  metadata.location.building,
  metadata.location.floor,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
  MAX(temperature) AS max_temp,
  MIN(temperature) AS min_temp,
  COUNT(*) AS reading_count
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= '2025-08-24 00:00:00'
  AND metadata.sensor_type = 'environmental'
GROUP BY 
  metadata.location.building,
  metadata.location.floor,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp)
ORDER BY hour DESC, building, floor;

-- Daily facility summaries
SELECT
  metadata.facility,
  DATE(timestamp) AS date,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_daily_temp,
  STDDEV(temperature) AS temp_variance,
  COUNT(DISTINCT metadata.sensor_id) AS active_sensors
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY metadata.facility, DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC, facility;
```

## Advanced Time-Series Patterns

### Moving Averages and Windowing

Calculate sliding windows for trend analysis:

```sql
-- 10-minute moving average temperature
WITH moving_avg AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.sensor_id,
    timestamp,
    temperature,
    AVG(temperature) OVER (
      PARTITION BY metadata.sensor_id 
      ORDER BY timestamp 
      ROWS BETWEEN 9 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS moving_avg_10min
  FROM sensor_readings
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-08-24 12:00:00'
    AND timestamp <= '2025-08-24 18:00:00'
    AND metadata.sensor_type = 'environmental'
)
SELECT 
  sensor_id,
  timestamp,
  temperature,
  moving_avg_10min,
  temperature - moving_avg_10min AS deviation
FROM moving_avg
WHERE ABS(temperature - moving_avg_10min) > 2.0  -- Anomaly detection
ORDER BY sensor_id, timestamp;
```

### Time-Series Interpolation

Fill gaps in time-series data with interpolated values:

```sql
-- Generate hourly time series with interpolation
WITH time_grid AS (
  SELECT generate_series(
    '2025-08-24 00:00:00'::timestamp,
    '2025-08-24 23:59:59'::timestamp,
    '1 hour'::interval
  ) AS hour
),
sensor_hourly AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.sensor_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
    COUNT(*) AS reading_count
  FROM sensor_readings
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-08-24 00:00:00'
    AND timestamp < '2025-08-25 00:00:00'
    AND metadata.facility = 'warehouse_A'
  GROUP BY metadata.sensor_id, DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp)
)
SELECT 
  tg.hour,
  sh.sensor_id,
  COALESCE(
    sh.avg_temp,
    LAG(sh.avg_temp) OVER (PARTITION BY sh.sensor_id ORDER BY tg.hour)
  ) AS temperature,
  sh.reading_count
FROM time_grid tg
LEFT JOIN sensor_hourly sh ON tg.hour = sh.hour
WHERE sh.sensor_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY sensor_id, hour;
```

## Application Performance Monitoring

Time-series collections excel at storing application metrics and performance data:

```javascript
// APM document structure
{
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-24T14:30:15Z"),
  "response_time": 245,
  "request_count": 1,
  "error_count": 0,
  "cpu_usage": 45.2,
  "memory_usage": 1024.5,
  "metadata": {
    "service": "user-api",
    "version": "v2.1.4",
    "instance": "api-server-03",
    "environment": "production",
    "datacenter": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Performance Analytics Queries

```sql
-- Service performance dashboard
SELECT 
  metadata.service,
  metadata.environment,
  DATE_TRUNC('minute', timestamp) AS minute,
  AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_ms,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time) AS p95_response_ms,
  SUM(request_count) AS total_requests,
  SUM(error_count) AS total_errors,
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM(request_count) > 0 
    THEN (SUM(error_count) * 100.0 / SUM(request_count))
    ELSE 0 
  END AS error_rate_pct
FROM performance_metrics
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND metadata.environment = 'production'
GROUP BY 
  metadata.service,
  metadata.environment,
  DATE_TRUNC('minute', timestamp)
ORDER BY minute DESC, service;

-- Resource utilization trends
SELECT 
  metadata.instance,
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
  MAX(cpu_usage) AS peak_cpu,
  MAX(memory_usage) AS peak_memory_mb,
  AVG(cpu_usage) AS avg_cpu,
  AVG(memory_usage) AS avg_memory_mb
FROM performance_metrics
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND metadata.service = 'user-api'
GROUP BY metadata.instance, DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp)
ORDER BY hour DESC, instance;
```

### Anomaly Detection

Identify performance anomalies using statistical analysis:

```sql
-- Detect response time anomalies
WITH performance_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.service,
    AVG(response_time) AS avg_response,
    STDDEV(response_time) AS stddev_response
  FROM performance_metrics
  WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 days'
    AND metadata.environment = 'production'
  GROUP BY metadata.service
),
recent_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.service,
    timestamp,
    response_time,
    metadata.instance
  FROM performance_metrics
  WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    AND metadata.environment = 'production'
)
SELECT 
  rm.service,
  rm.timestamp,
  rm.instance,
  rm.response_time,
  ps.avg_response,
  (rm.response_time - ps.avg_response) / ps.stddev_response AS z_score,
  CASE 
    WHEN ABS((rm.response_time - ps.avg_response) / ps.stddev_response) > 3
    THEN 'CRITICAL_ANOMALY'
    WHEN ABS((rm.response_time - ps.avg_response) / ps.stddev_response) > 2  
    THEN 'WARNING_ANOMALY'
    ELSE 'NORMAL'
  END AS anomaly_status
FROM recent_metrics rm
JOIN performance_stats ps ON rm.service = ps.service
WHERE ABS((rm.response_time - ps.avg_response) / ps.stddev_response) > 2
ORDER BY ABS((rm.response_time - ps.avg_response) / ps.stddev_response) DESC;
```

## Financial Time-Series Data

Handle high-frequency trading data and market analytics:

```javascript
// Market data structure
{
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-24T14:30:15.123Z"),
  "open": 150.25,
  "high": 150.75,
  "low": 150.10,
  "close": 150.60,
  "volume": 1250,
  "metadata": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "exchange": "NASDAQ",
    "data_provider": "market_feed_01",
    "market_session": "regular"
  }
}
```

### Financial Analytics

```sql
-- OHLCV data with technical indicators
WITH price_data AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.symbol,
    timestamp,
    close,
    volume,
    LAG(close, 1) OVER (
      PARTITION BY metadata.symbol 
      ORDER BY timestamp
    ) AS prev_close,
    AVG(close) OVER (
      PARTITION BY metadata.symbol 
      ORDER BY timestamp 
      ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS sma_20,
    AVG(close) OVER (
      PARTITION BY metadata.symbol 
      ORDER BY timestamp 
      ROWS BETWEEN 49 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW  
    ) AS sma_50
  FROM market_data
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-08-24 09:30:00'
    AND timestamp <= '2025-08-24 16:00:00'
    AND metadata.exchange = 'NASDAQ'
)
SELECT 
  symbol,
  timestamp,
  close,
  volume,
  CASE 
    WHEN prev_close > 0 
    THEN ((close - prev_close) / prev_close * 100)
    ELSE 0 
  END AS price_change_pct,
  sma_20,
  sma_50,
  CASE 
    WHEN sma_20 > sma_50 THEN 'BULLISH_SIGNAL'
    WHEN sma_20 < sma_50 THEN 'BEARISH_SIGNAL'
    ELSE 'NEUTRAL'
  END AS trend_signal
FROM price_data
WHERE sma_50 IS NOT NULL  -- Ensure we have enough data
ORDER BY symbol, timestamp DESC;

-- Trading volume analysis
SELECT 
  metadata.symbol,
  DATE(timestamp) AS trading_date,
  COUNT(*) AS tick_count,
  SUM(volume) AS total_volume,
  AVG(volume) AS avg_volume_per_tick,
  MAX(high) AS daily_high,
  MIN(low) AS daily_low,
  FIRST_VALUE(open) OVER (
    PARTITION BY metadata.symbol, DATE(timestamp)
    ORDER BY timestamp
  ) AS daily_open,
  LAST_VALUE(close) OVER (
    PARTITION BY metadata.symbol, DATE(timestamp)
    ORDER BY timestamp
  ) AS daily_close
FROM market_data
WHERE timestamp >= '2025-08-01'
  AND metadata.market_session = 'regular'
GROUP BY metadata.symbol, DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY trading_date DESC, symbol;
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Efficient Indexing for Time-Series

```javascript
// Create optimized indexes for time-series queries
db.sensor_readings.createIndex({
  "metadata.facility": 1,
  "timestamp": 1
})

db.sensor_readings.createIndex({
  "metadata.sensor_id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1
})

db.performance_metrics.createIndex({
  "metadata.service": 1,
  "metadata.environment": 1, 
  "timestamp": 1
})
```

SQL equivalent for index planning:

```sql
-- Index recommendations for common time-series queries
CREATE INDEX idx_sensor_facility_time ON sensor_readings (
  (metadata.facility),
  timestamp DESC
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sensor_id_time ON sensor_readings (
  (metadata.sensor_id),
  timestamp DESC  
);

-- Covering index for performance metrics
CREATE INDEX idx_perf_service_env_time_covering ON performance_metrics (
  (metadata.service),
  (metadata.environment),
  timestamp DESC
) INCLUDE (response_time, request_count, error_count);
```

### Data Retention and Partitioning

Implement time-based data lifecycle management:

```sql
-- Automated data retention
WITH old_data AS (
  SELECT _id
  FROM sensor_readings
  WHERE timestamp < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
  LIMIT 10000  -- Batch deletion
)
DELETE FROM sensor_readings
WHERE _id IN (SELECT _id FROM old_data);

-- Archive old data before deletion
INSERT INTO sensor_readings_archive
SELECT * FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND timestamp < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Create summary tables for historical data
INSERT INTO daily_sensor_summaries (
  date,
  sensor_id,
  facility,
  avg_temperature,
  max_temperature, 
  min_temperature,
  reading_count
)
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) AS date,
  metadata.sensor_id,
  metadata.facility,
  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature,
  MAX(temperature) AS max_temperature,
  MIN(temperature) AS min_temperature,
  COUNT(*) AS reading_count
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND timestamp < CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY 
  DATE(timestamp),
  metadata.sensor_id,
  metadata.facility;
```

## Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts

### Threshold-Based Alerting

```sql
-- Real-time temperature monitoring
SELECT 
  metadata.sensor_id,
  metadata.location.building,
  metadata.location.room,
  timestamp,
  temperature,
  CASE 
    WHEN temperature > 35 THEN 'CRITICAL_HIGH'
    WHEN temperature > 30 THEN 'WARNING_HIGH'
    WHEN temperature < 5 THEN 'CRITICAL_LOW'
    WHEN temperature < 10 THEN 'WARNING_LOW'
    ELSE 'NORMAL'
  END AS alert_level
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  AND metadata.sensor_type = 'environmental'
  AND (temperature > 30 OR temperature < 10)
ORDER BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN temperature > 35 OR temperature < 5 THEN 1
    ELSE 2
  END,
  timestamp DESC;

-- Service health monitoring  
SELECT 
  metadata.service,
  metadata.instance,
  AVG(response_time) AS avg_response,
  SUM(error_count) AS error_count,
  SUM(request_count) AS request_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM(request_count) > 0 
    THEN (SUM(error_count) * 100.0 / SUM(request_count))
    ELSE 0 
  END AS error_rate,
  CASE
    WHEN AVG(response_time) > 1000 THEN 'CRITICAL_SLOW'
    WHEN AVG(response_time) > 500 THEN 'WARNING_SLOW'
    WHEN SUM(error_count) * 100.0 / NULLIF(SUM(request_count), 0) > 5 THEN 'HIGH_ERROR_RATE'
    ELSE 'HEALTHY'
  END AS health_status
FROM performance_metrics
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  AND metadata.environment = 'production'
GROUP BY metadata.service, metadata.instance
HAVING health_status != 'HEALTHY'
ORDER BY 
  CASE health_status
    WHEN 'CRITICAL_SLOW' THEN 1
    WHEN 'HIGH_ERROR_RATE' THEN 2
    WHEN 'WARNING_SLOW' THEN 3
  END,
  error_rate DESC;
```

## QueryLeaf Time-Series Integration

QueryLeaf automatically optimizes time-series queries and provides intelligent query planning:

```sql
-- QueryLeaf handles time-series collection optimization automatically
WITH hourly_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    metadata.facility,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
    AVG(humidity) AS avg_humidity,
    COUNT(*) AS reading_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT metadata.sensor_id) AS sensor_count
  FROM sensor_readings
  WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
    AND metadata.sensor_type = 'environmental'
  GROUP BY metadata.facility, DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp)
)
SELECT 
  facility,
  hour,
  avg_temp,
  avg_humidity,
  reading_count,
  sensor_count,
  LAG(avg_temp) OVER (
    PARTITION BY facility 
    ORDER BY hour
  ) AS prev_hour_temp,
  avg_temp - LAG(avg_temp) OVER (
    PARTITION BY facility 
    ORDER BY hour
  ) AS temp_change
FROM hourly_metrics
WHERE hour >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY facility, hour DESC;

-- QueryLeaf automatically:
-- 1. Uses time-series collection bucketing
-- 2. Optimizes temporal range queries
-- 3. Leverages efficient aggregation pipelines
-- 4. Provides index recommendations
-- 5. Handles metadata field queries optimally
```
