# MongoDB Transactions and ACID Operations: SQL-Style Data Consistency

One of the most significant differences between traditional SQL databases and MongoDB has historically been transaction support. While MongoDB has supported ACID properties within single documents since its inception, multi-document transactions were only introduced in version 4.0, with cross-shard support added in version 4.2.

Understanding how to implement robust transactional patterns in MongoDB using SQL-style syntax ensures your applications maintain data consistency while leveraging document database flexibility.

## The Transaction Challenge

Consider a financial application where you need to transfer money between accounts. This operation requires updating multiple documents atomically - if any part fails, the entire operation must be rolled back.

Traditional SQL makes this straightforward:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = balance - 100 
WHERE account_id = 'account_001';

UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = balance + 100 
WHERE account_id = 'account_002';

INSERT INTO transaction_log (from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp)
VALUES ('account_001', 'account_002', 100, NOW());

COMMIT;
```

In MongoDB, this same operation historically required complex application-level coordination:

```javascript
// Complex MongoDB approach without transactions
const session = client.startSession();

try {
  await session.withTransaction(async () => {
    const accounts = db.collection('accounts');
    const logs = db.collection('transaction_log');
    
    // Check source account balance
    const sourceAccount = await accounts.findOne(
      { account_id: 'account_001' }, 
      { session }
    );
    
    if (sourceAccount.balance < 100) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient funds');
    }
    
    // Update accounts
    await accounts.updateOne(
      { account_id: 'account_001' },
      { $inc: { balance: -100 } },
      { session }
    );
    
    await accounts.updateOne(
      { account_id: 'account_002' },
      { $inc: { balance: 100 } },
      { session }
    );
    
    // Log transaction
    await logs.insertOne({
      from_account: 'account_001',
      to_account: 'account_002', 
      amount: 100,
      timestamp: new Date()
    }, { session });
  });
} finally {
  await session.endSession();
}
```

## SQL-Style Transaction Syntax

Using SQL patterns makes transaction handling much more intuitive:

```sql
-- Begin transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Verify sufficient funds
SELECT balance 
FROM accounts 
WHERE account_id = 'account_001' 
  AND balance >= 100;

-- Update accounts atomically
UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = balance - 100,
    last_modified = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE account_id = 'account_001';

UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = balance + 100,
    last_modified = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
WHERE account_id = 'account_002';

-- Create audit trail
INSERT INTO transaction_log (
  transaction_id,
  from_account, 
  to_account, 
  amount,
  transaction_type,
  timestamp,
  status
) VALUES (
  'txn_' + RANDOM_UUID(),
  'account_001',
  'account_002', 
  100,
  'transfer',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  'completed'
);

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

## Transaction Isolation Levels

MongoDB supports different isolation levels that map to familiar SQL concepts:

### Read Uncommitted
```sql
-- Set transaction isolation
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- This might read uncommitted data from other transactions
SELECT SUM(balance) FROM accounts 
WHERE account_type = 'checking';

COMMIT;
```

### Read Committed (Default)
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Only sees data committed before transaction started
SELECT account_id, balance, last_modified
FROM accounts 
WHERE customer_id = 'cust_123'
ORDER BY last_modified DESC;

COMMIT;
```

### Snapshot Isolation
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Consistent snapshot of data throughout transaction
SELECT 
  c.customer_name,
  c.email,
  SUM(a.balance) AS total_balance,
  COUNT(a.account_id) AS account_count
FROM customers c
JOIN accounts a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.email
HAVING SUM(a.balance) > 10000;

COMMIT;
```

## Complex Business Workflows

### E-commerce Order Processing

Consider placing an order that involves inventory management, payment processing, and order creation:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Verify product availability
SELECT 
  p.product_id,
  p.name,
  p.price,
  i.quantity_available,
  i.reserved_quantity
FROM products p
JOIN inventory i ON p.product_id = i.product_id  
WHERE p.product_id IN ('prod_001', 'prod_002')
  AND i.quantity_available >= CASE p.product_id 
    WHEN 'prod_001' THEN 2
    WHEN 'prod_002' THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END;

-- Reserve inventory
UPDATE inventory
SET reserved_quantity = reserved_quantity + 2,
    quantity_available = quantity_available - 2,
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE product_id = 'prod_001';

UPDATE inventory  
SET reserved_quantity = reserved_quantity + 1,
    quantity_available = quantity_available - 1,
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE product_id = 'prod_002';

-- Create order
INSERT INTO orders (
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  status,
  total_amount,
  payment_status,
  items
) VALUES (
  'order_' + RANDOM_UUID(),
  'cust_456',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  'pending_payment',
  359.97,
  'processing',
  JSON_ARRAY(
    JSON_OBJECT(
      'product_id', 'prod_001',
      'quantity', 2,
      'price', 149.99
    ),
    JSON_OBJECT(
      'product_id', 'prod_002', 
      'quantity', 1,
      'price', 59.99
    )
  )
);

-- Process payment
INSERT INTO payments (
  payment_id,
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  payment_method,
  status,
  processed_at
) VALUES (
  'pay_' + RANDOM_UUID(),
  LAST_INSERT_ID(),
  'cust_456',
  359.97,
  'credit_card',
  'completed',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Update order status
UPDATE orders
SET status = 'confirmed',
    payment_status = 'completed',
    confirmed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE order_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

COMMIT;
```

### Handling Transaction Failures

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Savepoint for partial rollback
SAVEPOINT before_payment;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 'checking_001';

-- Attempt payment processing
INSERT INTO payment_attempts (
  account_id,
  amount, 
  merchant,
  attempt_time,
  status
) VALUES (
  'checking_001',
  500,
  'ACME Store',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  'processing'
);

-- Check if payment succeeded (simulated)
SELECT status FROM payment_gateway 
WHERE transaction_ref = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- If payment failed, rollback to savepoint
-- ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_payment;

-- If successful, complete the transaction
UPDATE payment_attempts
SET status = 'completed',
    completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE transaction_ref = LAST_INSERT_ID();

COMMIT;
```

## Multi-Collection Consistency Patterns

### Master-Detail Relationships

Maintain consistency between header and detail records:

```javascript
// Sample order document structure
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "order_id": "order_12345",
  "customer_id": "cust_456", 
  "order_date": ISODate("2025-08-19"),
  "status": "pending",
  "total_amount": 0,  // Calculated from items
  "item_count": 0,    // Calculated from items
  "last_modified": ISODate("2025-08-19")
}

// Order items in separate collection
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "order_id": "order_12345",
  "line_number": 1,
  "product_id": "prod_001",
  "quantity": 2,
  "unit_price": 149.99,
  "line_total": 299.98
}
```

Update both collections atomically:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Insert order header
INSERT INTO orders (
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  status,
  total_amount,
  item_count
) VALUES (
  'order_12345',
  'cust_456', 
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  'pending',
  0,
  0
);

-- Insert order items
INSERT INTO order_items (
  order_id,
  line_number,
  product_id,
  quantity,
  unit_price,
  line_total
) VALUES 
  ('order_12345', 1, 'prod_001', 2, 149.99, 299.98),
  ('order_12345', 2, 'prod_002', 1, 59.99, 59.99);

-- Update order totals
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = (
  SELECT SUM(line_total) 
  FROM order_items 
  WHERE order_id = 'order_12345'
),
item_count = (
  SELECT SUM(quantity)
  FROM order_items
  WHERE order_id = 'order_12345'  
),
last_modified = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE order_id = 'order_12345';

COMMIT;
```

## Performance Optimization for Transactions

### Transaction Scope Minimization

Keep transactions short and focused:

```sql
-- Good: Minimal transaction scope
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE inventory 
SET quantity = quantity - 1
WHERE product_id = 'prod_001'
  AND quantity > 0;

INSERT INTO reservations (product_id, customer_id, reserved_at)
VALUES ('prod_001', 'cust_123', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

COMMIT;

-- Avoid: Long-running transactions
-- BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Complex calculations...
-- External API calls...
-- COMMIT;
```

### Batching Operations

Group related operations efficiently:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Batch inventory updates
UPDATE inventory 
SET quantity = CASE product_id
  WHEN 'prod_001' THEN quantity - 2
  WHEN 'prod_002' THEN quantity - 1
  WHEN 'prod_003' THEN quantity - 3
  ELSE quantity
END,
reserved = reserved + CASE product_id
  WHEN 'prod_001' THEN 2
  WHEN 'prod_002' THEN 1  
  WHEN 'prod_003' THEN 3
  ELSE 0
END
WHERE product_id IN ('prod_001', 'prod_002', 'prod_003');

-- Batch order item insertion
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES 
  ('order_456', 'prod_001', 2, 29.99),
  ('order_456', 'prod_002', 1, 49.99),
  ('order_456', 'prod_003', 3, 19.99);

COMMIT;
```

## Error Handling and Retry Logic

### Transient Error Recovery

```sql
-- Implement retry logic for write conflicts
RETRY_TRANSACTION: BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Critical business operation
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - CASE 
  WHEN account_type = 'checking' THEN 100
  WHEN account_type = 'savings' THEN 95  -- Fee discount
  ELSE 105  -- Premium fee
END,
transaction_count = transaction_count + 1,
last_transaction_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE customer_id = 'cust_789'
  AND account_status = 'active'
  AND balance >= 100;

-- Verify update succeeded
SELECT ROW_COUNT() AS updated_rows;

-- Create transaction record
INSERT INTO account_transactions (
  transaction_id,
  customer_id,
  transaction_type,
  amount,
  balance_after,
  processed_at
) 
SELECT 
  'txn_' + RANDOM_UUID(),
  'cust_789',
  'withdrawal',
  100,
  balance,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM accounts 
WHERE customer_id = 'cust_789'
  AND account_type = 'checking';

-- If write conflict occurs, retry with exponential backoff
-- ON WRITE_CONFLICT RETRY RETRY_TRANSACTION AFTER DELAY(RANDOM() * 1000);

COMMIT;
```

## Advanced Transaction Patterns

### Compensating Transactions

Implement saga patterns for distributed operations:

```sql
-- Order placement saga
BEGIN TRANSACTION 'order_placement_saga';

-- Step 1: Reserve inventory
INSERT INTO saga_steps (
  saga_id,
  step_name, 
  operation_type,
  compensation_sql,
  status
) VALUES (
  'saga_order_123',
  'reserve_inventory',
  'UPDATE',
  'UPDATE inventory SET reserved = reserved - 2 WHERE product_id = ''prod_001''',
  'pending'
);

UPDATE inventory 
SET reserved = reserved + 2
WHERE product_id = 'prod_001';

-- Step 2: Process payment
INSERT INTO saga_steps (
  saga_id,
  step_name,
  operation_type, 
  compensation_sql,
  status
) VALUES (
  'saga_order_123',
  'process_payment',
  'INSERT',
  'DELETE FROM payments WHERE payment_id = ''pay_456''',
  'pending'
);

INSERT INTO payments (payment_id, amount, status)
VALUES ('pay_456', 199.98, 'processed');

-- Step 3: Create order
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, status, total_amount)
VALUES ('order_123', 'cust_456', 'confirmed', 199.98);

-- Mark saga as completed
UPDATE saga_steps 
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE saga_id = 'saga_order_123';

COMMIT;
```

### Read-Only Transactions for Analytics

Ensure consistent reporting across multiple collections:

```sql
-- Consistent financial reporting
BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY;

-- Get snapshot timestamp
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS report_timestamp;

-- Account balances
SELECT 
  account_type,
  COUNT(*) AS account_count,
  SUM(balance) AS total_balance,
  AVG(balance) AS average_balance
FROM accounts
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY account_type;

-- Transaction volume
SELECT 
  DATE(transaction_date) AS date,
  transaction_type,
  COUNT(*) AS transaction_count,
  SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE(transaction_date), transaction_type
ORDER BY date DESC, transaction_type;

-- Customer activity
SELECT
  c.customer_segment,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t.customer_id) AS active_customers,
  AVG(t.amount) AS avg_transaction_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id  
WHERE t.transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND t.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_segment;

COMMIT;
```

## MongoDB-Specific Transaction Features

### Working with Sharded Collections

```sql
-- Cross-shard transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Update documents across multiple shards
UPDATE user_profiles
SET last_login = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    login_count = login_count + 1
WHERE user_id = 'user_123';  -- Shard key

UPDATE user_activity_log
SET login_events = ARRAY_APPEND(
  login_events,
  JSON_OBJECT(
    'timestamp', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    'ip_address', '192.168.1.1',
    'user_agent', 'Mozilla/5.0...'
  )
)
WHERE user_id = 'user_123';  -- Same shard key

COMMIT;
```

### Time-Based Data Operations

```sql
-- Session cleanup transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Archive expired sessions
INSERT INTO archived_sessions
SELECT * FROM active_sessions
WHERE expires_at < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Remove expired sessions  
DELETE FROM active_sessions
WHERE expires_at < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Update session statistics
UPDATE session_stats
SET expired_count = expired_count + ROW_COUNT(),
    last_cleanup = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;

COMMIT;
```

## QueryLeaf Transaction Integration

QueryLeaf provides seamless transaction support, automatically handling MongoDB session management and translating SQL transaction syntax:

```sql
-- QueryLeaf handles session lifecycle automatically
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Complex business logic with joins and aggregations
WITH customer_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_tier,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
  FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  WHERE o.order_date >= '2025-01-01'
    AND o.status = 'completed'
  GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_tier
  HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 1000
)
UPDATE customers
SET customer_tier = CASE
  WHEN co.total_spent > 5000 THEN 'platinum'
  WHEN co.total_spent > 2500 THEN 'gold'  
  WHEN co.total_spent > 1000 THEN 'silver'
  ELSE customer_tier
END,
tier_updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM customer_orders co
WHERE customers.customer_id = co.customer_id;

-- Insert tier change log
INSERT INTO tier_changes (
  customer_id,
  old_tier,
  new_tier, 
  change_reason,
  changed_at
)
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  c.previous_tier,
  c.customer_tier,
  'purchase_volume',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM customers c
WHERE c.tier_updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

COMMIT;
```

QueryLeaf automatically optimizes transaction boundaries, manages MongoDB sessions, and provides proper error handling and retry logic.
