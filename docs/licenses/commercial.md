# Commercial License

## Overview

The Commercial License is designed to provide maximum flexibility for commercial users while ensuring the continued development and maintenance of QueryLeaf.

## Benefits of the Commercial License

The Commercial License offers several benefits over the AGPL-3.0 license:

1. **No Source Code Disclosure**: You can modify QueryLeaf without having to disclose your source code when your application is used over a network
2. **Commercial Use**: You can embed QueryLeaf in commercial products
3. **Private Modifications**: You can make private modifications without sharing them
4. **Support Options**: Access to paid support and maintenance
5. **Legal Certainty**: Clear license terms designed for commercial use

2. **Modify** the software to suit your needs
3. **Integrate** the software into your applications, services, or systems
4. **Distribute** the software as part of your applications, provided that the software is not the primary value of your product

### Restrictions

2. Transfer, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or distribute the software as a standalone product
3. Remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the software
