# Pricing & Licensing

QueryLeaf uses a dual-licensing model designed to balance open source availability with sustainable commercial development.

## Licensing Options

QueryLeaf is available under two licensing options:

1. **AGPL v3 License (Community Edition)** - Free for open source projects, personal use, and evaluation
2. **Commercial License** - For commercial use in proprietary applications

## Community Edition

The Community Edition of QueryLeaf is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This license:

- Allows free use, modification, and distribution of the software
- Requires that any modifications to the software be shared under the same license
- Requires source code disclosure if you run a modified version of the software as a service over a network
- Has strong copyleft provisions that may affect proprietary applications

The AGPL license is perfect for:
- Open source projects
- Personal projects
- Educational purposes
- Evaluation before purchase

## Commercial License

Our Commercial License is designed for businesses and organizations that require more flexibility in how they use and distribute QueryLeaf. This license:

- Removes the AGPL requirements for source code disclosure
- Allows integration into proprietary software without license contamination
- Provides commercial support options
- Includes all components: Library, CLI, Web Server, and PostgreSQL Server

## Server Components and Licensing

Both the Web Server and PostgreSQL Server components are covered under the same dual-licensing model. This means:

1. **Under AGPL**: If you run either server as a service, you must make the source code (including any modifications) available to users of that service.

2. **Under Commercial License**: You can run and distribute the server components as part of your proprietary applications without AGPL obligations.

The PostgreSQL Server component is particularly valuable for commercial users as it allows seamless integration with existing PostgreSQL clients and tools, making it ideal for enterprise deployments.
